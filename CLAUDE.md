### BitChat P2P Mesh Network Integration
The **SafeGuardianMeshManager** provides seamless integration:

**Core Integration:**
```swift
class SafeGuardianMeshManager: ObservableObject, BitchatDelegate {
    @Published var isConnected: Bool = false
    @Published var connectedPeers: [String] = []
    @Published var messages: [SafeGuardianMessage] = []
    
    private let meshService = BluetoothMeshService()
    
    // BitChat handles all networking, encryption, peer discovery
    // SafeGuardian gets clean UI-ready data via delegate methods
}
```

**Safety-Specific Features:**
- **Emergency Broadcasting**: `sendEmergencyBroadcast()` for urgent alerts
- **Network Quality**: Real-time mesh network health indicators
- **Offline Communication**: P2P messaging without internet via Bluetooth mesh
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Automatic via BitChat's Noise Protocol implementation

### AI Safety System Architecture
The **SafetyAIGuide** class implements a deterministic rule engine:
- **Emergency Detection**: Keywords trigger 911 prioritization and emergency alerts
- **Keyword Pattern Matching**: "emergency"/"help" → 911 guidance, "route"/"safe" → location advice
- **Streaming Simulation**: Character-by-character responses for natural feel
- **State Management**: `@Published` properties for SwiftUI reactivity
- **Safety-First Design**: All responses prioritize contacting authorities over general advice
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure Swift implementation, works offline

### Component Architecture Pattern
The app uses a **composition-based component system** with reusable UI elements:
- **SafetyIndicator**: Animated status circles showing mesh network connectivity
- **ActionCard**: Emergency action buttons with gradient backgrounds
- **MessageBubble/AIMessageBubble**: Chat components with BitChat delivery status
- **ConnectionStatusSection**: Real-time mesh network status displays
- **EmergencyServiceAnnotation**: MapKit annotations for emergency services

## Development Guidelines

### SwiftUI Architecture Patterns
- **Modular View Design**: Each tab integrates with BitChat via SafeGuardianMeshManager
- **MVVM with ObservableObject**: BitChat data flows through `@Published` properties
- **State Management**: `@StateObject` for mesh manager, `@State` for local UI state
- **Real-time Updates**: BitChat delegate methods update SafeGuardian UI automatically
- **Responsive Design**: Mesh network status displayed consistently across all tabs

### BitChat Integration Patterns
- **Clean Wrapper**: SafeGuardianMeshManager is the only BitChat integration point
- **Delegate Pattern**: BitchatDelegate provides real-time networking updates
- **Type Conversion**: BitChat types converted to SafeGuardian UI types
- **Safety Enhancement**: Emergency features layered on top of BitChat networking
- **UI Consistency**: BitChat invisible to users, SafeGuardian branding throughout

### Design System & Styling
- **Safety-First Colors**: Red for emergency, blue for network, green for safe status
- **Network Status Indicators**: Consistent mesh connectivity displays across all views
- **Emergency Priority**: Red emergency buttons prominent in all interfaces
- **Gradient Usage**: LinearGradient for status indicators and action buttons
- **SF Symbols**: Consistent iconography (antenna.radiowaves, shield.checkered, etc.)

### Safety AI Implementation Rules
The SafetyAIGuide implements these safety priorities:
1. **Emergency Detection**: Keywords "emergency"/"help" trigger immediate 911 alerts
2. **Authority Priority**: All responses emphasize contacting emergency services first
3. **Mesh Network Aware**: Can recommend mesh chat for community communication
4. **Offline Capable**: Works without internet, suggests mesh network for help

## Testing

The project includes standard iOS test targets with BitChat integration:
- `safeguardianTests`: Unit tests including mesh network integration
- `safeguardianUITests`: UI automation tests for all five tabs

**BitChat Testing Notes:**
- Mesh networking requires physical devices for full testing
- Simulator testing covers UI integration and delegate method handling
- Emergency features tested with mock BitChat responses

## CRITICAL AI IMPLEMENTATION NOTE

**⚠️ NEVER USE KEYWORD DETECTION FOR AI RESPONSES - FIXED JANUARY 2025**

When implementing AI functionality (NexaAI, llama.cpp, etc.):
- **DO**: Use actual model inference for generating responses
- **DON'T**: Use keyword detection/matching as a substitute for AI
- **WHY**: Downloading a 150MB GGUF model to do keyword matching is fundamentally wrong
- **CORRECT APPROACH**: Pass user prompts to the loaded model and return the model's generated output

**✅ CURRENT STATUS (January 2025):**
- **FIXED**: Removed all hardcoded keyword detection responses
- **IMPLEMENTED**: RealNexaAI class ready for actual SDK integration
- **READY**: Safety-focused system prompts and proper model inference architecture

**Example of WRONG approach (REMOVED):**
```swift
if containsEmergencyKeywords(prompt) {
    return "hardcoded emergency response"  // ❌ REMOVED
}
```

**Current CORRECT approach (IMPLEMENTED):**
```swift
// In RealNexaAI class - ready for NexaAI SDK
let config = GenerationConfig.default
config.maxTokens = 512
let response = try await llm.generate(prompt: createSafetyPrompt(userInput: prompt), config: config)
return response
```

## NexaAI Integration Status - January 2025

**✅ COMPLETED:**
- Removed all hardcoded responses and keyword detection
- Created `RealNexaAI` class with proper AI inference architecture  
- Implemented GGUF model downloading (~150MB Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct)
- Safety-first system prompt engineering
- Model file management in iOS Documents directory

**⚠️ PENDING:** 
- Add NexaAI SDK dependency to Xcode project
- Uncomment `import NexaAI` and replace `Any?` with `LLM?`
- Test real AI inference with downloaded models
